# myanmar_names (still working)

I use the [data](https://github.com/ye-kyaw-thu/myRoman/blob/main/person-name/person-name.ver1.0.txt) from Sayar <b>Ye Kyaw thu</b> and I inspired the work from Ko saturngod's [repo](https://github.com/saturngod/myanmar_names). I just make some EDA and want to do some improvment for name conversion.
